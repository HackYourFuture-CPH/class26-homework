# React template
This is a minimal React app based on the the [create-react-app tool](https://create-react-app.dev/).

## Creating a new project
1. Make sure you have [installed node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your PC
2. Copy the folder `minimal-template` and replace the name with the name of your app.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the newly created folder. 
    ``` shell
    cd <path to your folder>
    ``` 
4. Run below command in the terminal to install the dependencies. This is only required initially.
    ``` shell
    npm install
    ```

## Running the app
1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project folder. 
    ``` shell
    cd <path to your folder>
    ``` 
2. Start your application by running the below command. It should automatically open your app in your browser on http://localhost:3000/. If not, try to open the link yourself.
    ``` shell
    npm start
    ```
3. You can now make changes to your code and the app will automatically refresh. Happy coding :heart:
