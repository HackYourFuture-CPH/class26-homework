For making chole, first of all, rinse the chole in running water and then soak them in water for about 6-8 hours. Soaking will help to enhance the size of chole and it takes less time in cooking.
Boil the chole in 3 cups of water and with little bit of salt. You can pressure cook them for 6-8 whistles and then keep aside.
Slice 1 big onion and grind into a smooth paste. Also finely chop 2 tomatoes and 2 green chilies.
Now heat 1 tablespoon of cooking oil in a frying pan and add ground paste of onion. Cook the paste for about 2-3 minutes on low flame with continuous stirring, till the raw flavor of onion goes away. Do not over cook or burn it.
When the onion turns brown in color, then add fine chopped tomatoes along with green chilies. Cook continuously till the tomatoes turn mushy and a nice color of gravy comes out. Add 1/2 teaspoon Kashmiri Red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder, 1-1/2 teaspoon coriander powder, 1/4 teaspoon crushed black peppercorns, 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder, 1/2 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder) and salt to taste.
Stir continue for 2 more minutes and then add boiled chole. Drizzle few drops of water over it. Cover the pan, simmer the flame and leave to cook for 2-3 minutes on low flame, till the chole absorb the flavors of gravy and spices.
Garnish with some fine chopped fresh coriander leaves and serve with hot and fluffy puri.
