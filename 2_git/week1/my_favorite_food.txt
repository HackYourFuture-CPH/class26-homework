**Napolitan Milanesa Recipe**

**Ingredients:**
- 4 thin beef slices
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 cup breadcrumbs
- 2 eggs
- Vegetable oil for frying
- 1 cup tomato sauce
- 4 slices of ham
- 4 slices of mozzarella cheese
- Paprika (optional)
- French fries (for serving)

**Instructions:**

1. Season the beef slices with salt and pepper.

2. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs. Place the breadcrumbs on another plate.

3. Dip each beef slice into the beaten eggs, ensuring both sides are coated.

4. Press the egg-coated beef slices into the breadcrumbs, making sure they're evenly coated.

5. Heat vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat.

6. Fry the breaded beef slices until they are golden brown and crispy on both sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Drain them on paper towels.

7. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).

8. Place the fried beef slices on a baking sheet.

9. Top each slice with a generous spoonful of tomato sauce, a slice of ham, and a slice of mozzarella cheese.

10. Sprinkle a pinch of paprika over each milanesa for extra flavor (optional).

11. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10-15 minutes.

12. While the milanesas are baking, prepare your French fries according to your preferred method.

13. Once the milanesas are done, remove them from the oven.

14. Serve the Napolitan milanesas hot, with the crispy French fries on the side.

Enjoy this delicious blend of crispy and Italian-inspired flavors!
