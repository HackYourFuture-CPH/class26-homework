   - Let the spices cool down and then grind them into a fine powder using a spice grinder or mortar and pestle.

2. Prepare the Gravy:
   - Heat oil or ghee in a kadai (wok) or a heavy-bottomed pan.
   - Add the cumin seeds and let them splutter.

5. Paneer and Cream:
   - Add the paneer cubes and stir gently to coat them with the spice mix.
   - If you're using cream, add it at this stage and mix well. You can also use cashew cream for a creamier texture.

6. Kasuri Methi and Seasoning:
   - Crush the dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) between your palms and add them to the gravy.
   - Season with salt to taste. Remember that paneer is slightly salty, so adjust accordingly.

   - Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.

8. Serve:
   - Your Paneer Kadai is ready to be served hot with naan, roti, or rice.
