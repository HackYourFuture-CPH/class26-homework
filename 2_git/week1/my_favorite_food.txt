Finnish Salmon soup

Ingredients 
1/4 cup butter
1 leek, trimmed and sliced (about 2 cups)
4 cups fish stock or fish stock cubes
1 pound potatoes, cubed (2 to 3 cups)
1 carrot, sliced (about 1Â½ cups)
1 pound salmon, cut into large pieces
1 cup 35% cream
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
Chopped dill, for serving

Directions
In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the leeks and cook, stirring, for 5 to 6 minutes, until wilted.
Add the stock, potatoes, and carrots. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, until softened and fork-tender, depending on the size of the vegetables.
Add the salmon and cream and bring to a simmer. Cook for 5 to 6 minutes, until the salmon is cooked through; season with salt and pepper.
Divide the soup among bowls. Top with the dill.
