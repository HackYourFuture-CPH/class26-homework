Pizza Pachino Recipe:

Ingredients:

For the Pizza Dough:

1 pound (about 450g) pizza dough (store-bought or homemade)
Flour, for dusting
For the Tomato Sauce:

1 cup Pachino tomatoes (or cherry tomatoes), halved
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper, to taste
Fresh basil leaves, chopped
For the Toppings:

Fresh basil leaves, for garnish
Instructions:

Prepare the Tomato Sauce:

In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© until fragrant.
Add the halved Pachino tomatoes (or cherry tomatoes) to the skillet. Cook for a few minutes until the tomatoes soften and release their juices.
Use the back of a spoon to lightly crush the tomatoes and create a chunky sauce. Season with salt and pepper. Cook for a few more minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
Stir in the chopped fresh basil leaves and remove the sauce from the heat.
Prepare the Pizza Dough:

Preheat your oven according to the pizza dough package instructions or your recipe if using homemade dough.
On a floured surface, roll out the pizza dough to your desired thickness.
Assemble the Pizza:

Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.
Spread the prepared tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a border for the crust.
Arrange slices of fresh mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.
Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the mozzarella.
Baking:

Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated oven and bake according to the dough instructions or until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Finishing Touches:

Once the pizza is out of the oven, garnish it with additional fresh basil leaves for a burst of flavor and color.
Serving:


Allow the pizza to cool slightly before slicing and serving.
