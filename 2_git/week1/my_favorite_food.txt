Here's a classic donut recipe for you:

Ingredients:

For the donuts:

2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
¼ cup granulated sugar
2 teaspoons baking powder
½ teaspoon salt
½ teaspoon ground cinnamon
¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg
⅔ cup milk
2 large eggs
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
Vegetable oil (for frying)
For the glaze:

2 cups powdered sugar
¼ cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Instructions:

For the donuts:

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

In another bowl, whisk together the milk, eggs, and melted butter until well combined.

Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix; the dough should be slightly sticky.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough for about 1 hour.

On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough to a thickness of about ½ inch.

Use a donut cutter or two round cookie cutters (one larger and one smaller) to cut out donuts and donut holes.

Place the cut donuts and donut holes on a floured baking sheet, cover them with a clean cloth, and let them rise for about 20-30 minutes.

In a deep pot, heat vegetable oil to about 350°F (175°C).

Carefully place a few donuts at a time into the hot oil using a slotted spoon. Fry each side for about 1-2 minutes or until they turn golden brown.

Remove the donuts from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.

For the glaze:

In a bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract until you have a smooth glaze.
To assemble:

Dip each cooled donut into the glaze, letting any excess glaze drip off.

Place the glazed donuts on a wire rack to allow the glaze to set.
