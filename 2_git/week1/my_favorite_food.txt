Chole Puri Recipe is the popular North Indian Breakfast Dish, which can be served as a fulfilled meal in lunch or dinner. 
Some people enjoy it as a Snack Dish as well. 
Chole / Chickpea or Garbanzo beans is a versatile legume, and itâ€™s seeds are high in protein.
 I like the combo of Chole and Puri. 
 Here Chole or Chana are simply made in the tasty gravy of onion and tomatoes and then served with hot and fluffy puri.
