Homemade Macaroni and Cheese

Ingredients:

8 ounces elbow macaroni
2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese
1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
3 cups milk
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon paprika (optional)
1/2 cup breadcrumbs (for topping)
Instructions:

Cook the Macaroni:

Cook the elbow macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
Make the Cheese Sauce:

In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Stir in the flour and cook for about 1-2 minutes to form a roux.
Gradually whisk in the milk, ensuring no lumps form. Continue cooking and stirring until the sauce thickens, about 5-7 minutes.
Add Cheese and Seasonings:

Reduce the heat to low and stir in the shredded cheddar cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.
Add salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using) to the cheese sauce. Adjust seasonings to taste.
Combine Pasta and Cheese Sauce:

Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and gently stir until the pasta is coated with the cheese sauce.
Bake and Serve:

Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).
Transfer the macaroni and cheese mixture to a greased baking dish.
In a small bowl, combine breadcrumbs with a little melted butter for topping. Sprinkle the breadcrumb mixture over the macaroni and cheese.
Bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.

Serve:

Allow the macaroni and cheese to cool slightly before serving. Garnish with extra grated Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.
