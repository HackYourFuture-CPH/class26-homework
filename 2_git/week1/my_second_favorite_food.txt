 Veg Pulav Recipe with detailed photo and video recipe. 
 An easy and simple flavored rice recipe made with long-grain rice, a choice of vegetables, and fresh herbs. 
 It is one of the popular rice variants or choices for many Indians and is often served for lunch and dinner, if not for morning breakfast.
  The simple pulao recipes do not contain all the required flavor and spice in them and can be served as it is, but tastes great when served with simple yogurt raita.
