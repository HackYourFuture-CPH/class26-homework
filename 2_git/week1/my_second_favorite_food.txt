Rinse 1.5 cups of basmati rice until water runs clear, then soak for 20-30 minutes.
Strain soaked rice and set aside.
Chop vegetables into small cubes, including cauliflower florets and thinly sliced onion.
Crush ginger, garlic, and green chilies to a paste using a mortar-pestle or grinder.
Heat 3 tbsp ghee/oil, add whole spices, fry briefly until fragrant, avoiding smoking.
Add 1 cup sliced onions, sauté until golden on low-medium heat.
Introduce ginger-garlic-chili paste, sauté briefly to remove raw aroma.
Add ½ cup chopped tomatoes, sauté 2-3 minutes on low heat.
Mix in chopped veggies, 2-3 tbsp each of coriander and optional mint leaves, sauté 2-3 minutes.
Add rice, sauté gently 1-2 minutes, pour 2.5 to 3 cups water, season with salt and lemon juice, cover and cook on low-medium heat until water is absorbed, occasionally checking water level and stirring carefully.
Serve garnished with coriander leaves, mint leaves, or fried onions, along with optional fried cashews or raisins.
