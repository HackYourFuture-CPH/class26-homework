**Mushroom Chicken Recipe**

**Ingredients:**
- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 8 ounces (about 225 grams) mushrooms, sliced
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme (or fresh thyme leaves)
- 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

**Instructions:**

1. Season chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.

2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken breasts and cook until browned and cooked through, about 6-7 minutes per side. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.

3. In the same skillet, add butter and sliced mushrooms. Cook until the mushrooms are browned and tender, about 5 minutes.

4. Add minced garlic to the skillet and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.

5. Pour in chicken broth, heavy cream, and dried thyme (or fresh thyme leaves). Stir well and bring the mixture to a simmer.

6. Reduce heat to low and return the cooked chicken breasts to the skillet. Simmer for an additional 5-7 minutes, allowing the chicken to absorb the flavors.

7. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the chicken breasts and sauce. Continue to simmer for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens and the cheese melts.

8. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley.

9. Serve the mushroom chicken hot, with your choice of side dishes like rice, pasta, or steamed vegetables.
