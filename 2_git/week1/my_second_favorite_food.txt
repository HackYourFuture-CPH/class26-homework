Ingredients:

For the Rice and Chicken Layers:

2 cups Basmati rice
2 large chicken breasts or 4 chicken thighs, cooked and shredded
1 onion, finely chopped
3 eggs
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1/4 cup melted butter or vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon ground saffron (dissolved in a little warm water)
Salt and pepper to taste
For the Lamb Layer:

1 lb (450g) lamb, cut into bite-sized pieces
1 onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
Salt and pepper to taste
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
Instructions:

Preparing the Rice:

Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in salted water for about 2 hours, then drain.
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the soaked rice and cook for about 6-7 minutes until the rice is parboiled. It should still have a firm bite.
Drain the rice and rinse it with cold water to stop the cooking process. Set aside.
Cooking the Lamb:

In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.
Add the minced garlic, ground turmeric, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Sauté for another minute.
Add the lamb pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove from heat and set aside.
Preparing the Chicken and Rice Mixture:

In a large bowl, combine the shredded cooked chicken, chopped onions, eggs, plain yogurt, melted butter or oil, saffron water, salt, and pepper. Mix well until everything is combined.
Assembling the Tahchin:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
Grease a round oven-safe casserole dish or non-stick pan with a little oil.
Place a layer of parboiled rice on the bottom of the dish, followed by a layer of the chicken and rice mixture, and finally a layer of the cooked lamb.
Layering and Baking:

Continue layering the rice and chicken mixture, and lamb until you've used up all the ingredients. Finish with a layer of rice on top.
Cover the casserole dish with aluminum foil or a lid to prevent moisture from escaping.
Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the tahchin is set and the top is golden brown.
Serving:

Once the tahchin is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly.
To serve, gently loosen the edges of the tahchin with a knife and invert it onto a serving platter. The golden, crispy rice crust should be on top.
Cut the tahchin into slices and serve with yogurt, fresh herbs, and a side salad
