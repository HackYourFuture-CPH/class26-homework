Here's a simple and delicious recipe for classic baked chicken:

Baked Chicken Recipe:

Ingredients:

4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon onion powder
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 teaspoon dried thyme (optional)
1/4 teaspoon dried rosemary (optional)
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano (optional)
Instructions:

Preheat the Oven:

Preheat your oven to 400째F (200째C).
Prepare the Chicken:

Pat the chicken breasts dry with paper towels to remove excess moisture.
Drizzle the olive oil over the chicken breasts, then rub the oil all over to coat them evenly.
Season the Chicken:

In a small bowl, mix together the salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, and any optional dried herbs.
Sprinkle the seasoning mixture evenly over both sides of the chicken breasts, pressing gently to adhere.
Bake the Chicken:

Place the seasoned chicken breasts on a baking sheet or in a baking dish.
Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165째F (74째C) and the chicken is cooked through.
Rest and Serve:

Once cooked, remove the chicken from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing or serving. This helps the juices redistribute throughout the meat.
Serve and Enjoy:

Serve the baked chicken with your choice of side dishes, such as roasted vegetables, rice, salad, or potatoes.
Feel free to customize the seasonings or add a marinade to suit your taste. You can also experiment with different herbs and spices to create a variety of flavor profiles for your baked chicken. Enjoy your meal!
