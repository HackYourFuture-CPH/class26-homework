Step 1
Preheat your oven to 200C fan-forced (220C conventional).

Step 2
In a bowl, toss together all the ingredients for the pie filling, except the bay leaf and flour, add a few cracks of black pepper and mix in two-thirds of a cup of water, then lay it all in the circular cast-iron pan or pie dish
you’re going to bake the pie in (it can be any size between 21cm and 26cm in diameter). Bake in the oven, uncovered, for 15 minutes.

Step 3
Remove the filling from the oven, sprinkle the flour over it and toss. Tuck in the bay leaf.

Step 4
For a pastry wash, crack the egg into a dish, add a teaspoon of water, mix and set aside.

Step 5
On a lightly floured bench, roll out your sheet of puff pastry so it’s slightly larger than the baking dish you’re using. Then lift it up and drape it over the dish, pressing it into the sides (I like to leave any excess just hanging over the edge). Cut a small “X” in the centre of the pie to allow steam to escape and brush the surface with your egg wash, sprinkling with flaky sea salt
and freshly cracked black pepper. (Vegans can use vegan milk for the wash.) Place the pie on a sheet tray lined with baking paper.

Step 6
Place in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, then reduce the heat to 180C fan-forced (200C conventional) and bake for a further 30-35 minutes until the top is a deep golden-brown. Allow to rest for 5 minutes, then serve with a fresh green salad.
